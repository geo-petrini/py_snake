Todo
- try pygame_gui for menus and options
- future branch with Kivy https://kivy.org/#home
- spawn food in free cell, avoid spawning onto another food or snake segment
- carnivorous snakes that cuts other snakes body
- textured background, with some kind of generative algorithm
- timer that shortens snakes if they do not eat
